# FutureMail üöÄ‚úâÔ∏è

## Overview
This project is an example of Prompt Engineering made in conversation with Chat-GPT. It's been a while since I coded something, so instead, I figured I'd let the machine take it for a spin.

FutureMail is a minimalistic web app crafted with a nostalgic 90s design aesthetic that allows users to send emails that will be delivered at a random point in the future, anywhere between one week and one year from the sending date. This app serves as a beautiful intersection between communication and surprise, enveloping messages in a cloak of future mystery.

## Features

- **Send Future Emails**: Enter recipient details, compose your email, and hit send.
- **Random Delivery**: The email gets delivered randomly between 1 week and 1 year into the future.
- **90s Web Design**: Experience a blast from the past with our retro-inspired UI.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, jQuery
- **Backend**: Python, Flask

## How to Use

1. **Sending Emails**: Simply visit the web page, fill out the email form, and press "Send". Your email will be scheduled for a random future delivery.
2. **No Signup Needed**: No user account or signup required. Just enter the message and recipient details, and you're good to go.

## Setup & Run Locally

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-link]
   cd [your-repo-name]

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash

   source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**

   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Flask Backend**

5. **Open the HTML File: Navigate to the index.html file and open it with your preferred web browser.**

## Future Enhancements
